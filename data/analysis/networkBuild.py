# Some structure (or maybe just a function that queriesâ€¦ bluh) that denotes a page. It contains, the page title, url, incoming links, outgoing links, confidence rating, number of links on page, network connections (perhaps you can set a threshold for network connections - you take the top 10 or top 20, and then build your visualization)
	# -Probably want to pick a small threshold (maybe even just 1), send that to client, and then let the client-side filter
	# Maybe this structure, built around their direct history, is what you send the client.
